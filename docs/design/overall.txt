The library should be able to construct an SCTP stack on top of one or more UDP sockets.
The stack controls the encapsulation sockets directly, with the application directing what
encapsulation port should be bound for usage. This is so that the stack can bind new addresses
as necessary during the application's run-time.
The library MUST implement IETF RFCs 9260, 6951, 3758, 4895, 7496, and 8260. Additional RFCs
MAY be implemented as required.
The library MUST provide an implementation of the POSIX Sockets functions as outlined by the
Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition, and IETF RFCs 3493, 3542, and 6458.
